I'm a Computer Science student at Cornell University.

Currently, I'm working on:
- Databases and Query Optimization
- Graph-Based Reasoning with LLMs
- Siamese Networks for Text Classifications

I also enjoy applying my knowledge in hackathons to create practical solutions with real-world relevance.
