ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm a Computer Science student at Cornell University.

âœ¨ Currently, I'm working on:
- Databases and Query Optimization
- Graph-Based Reasoning with LLMs
- Siamese Networks for Text Classifications

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy applying my knowledge in hackathons to create practical solutions with real-world relevance. ðŸ’»
